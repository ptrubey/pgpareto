\subsection{Alternative Geometries}
An alternative to projecting a distribution in $\mathcal{R}_+^d$ to $S_{p}^{d-1}$ would be to map
  $\mathcal{S}_{p}^{d-1}$ to an alternative geometry---some $\Omega^{d-1}$, and fitting a
  distribution in that space. Appropriate alternative geometries depend on $p$.  For
  $p = 1$---the simplex---one might consider isometric or additive logratios~\citep{aitchison1982},
  which map $\bm{x}\in\mathcal{R}_+^{d}$ to $(-\infty, \infty)^{d-1}$.  For $p = 2$---the Euclidean
  sphere---we have spherical coordinates, where we map $\bm{x}\in\mathcal{R}_+^d$ to $[0,\pi/2]^{d-1}$:
  \begin{equation*}
      \theta_{\ell} = \arccos\frac{x_{\ell}}{\pnorm{\bm{x}_{{\ell}:d}}{2}},\hspace{1cm}{\ell} = 1,\ldots,d-1.
  \end{equation*}
  These dimension reduction techniques are strongly affected by the ordering of dimensions.
