%To develop a multivariate PoT model for extreme values consider a 
%$d$-dimensional random vector $\bm{W} = (W_1, \ldots ,W_d)$  with 
%marginal distributions $F_1(w_1), \dots , F_d(w_d)$, and define its
%standardization as $\bm{Z} = (Z_1, \ldots , Z_d)$, where $Z_i = 1/ (1 - F_i(W_i)), \; i=1, \ldots , d$.
%Following the discussion in \cite{goix2017} we assume a form of 
%regular variation, consisting on assuming the existence of a 
%limiting measure $\mu$ on $(0,\infty]^d$, such that.
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:reg-var}
%        \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}n\prob{\frac{1}{n}\bm{Z}\not\leq \bm{z}} = \mu\left([\bm{0},\bm{z}]^c\right),
%\end{equation}
%where the inequality and the interval are taken componentwise. 
%In this setting, $\mu$ is the asymptotic distribution of $\bm{Z}$ 
%in extreme regions, and it is  referred to as the \emph{exponent
%measure}. In addition, we assume that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} 
%n\prob{\max\{Z_1, \ldots , Z_d\}>n} = 1$. Equation \ref{eq:reg-var}
%implies that $\mu$ has the homogeneity property $\mu(t\cdot) = 
%\frac{1}{t}\mu(\cdot)$i, and it can be shown that  $\mu$ 
%can be decomposed into a radial and an angular component. In fact, 
%for $\bm{z} = (z_1, \ldots , z_n) \in (0,\infty]^d$, let $r(\bm{z}) = 
%||\bm{z}||_\infty$ and $\bm{v}(\bm{z}) = \bm{z}/r(\bm{z})$. Define 
%$\Phi(B) = \mu(\{\bm{z} : r(\bm{z})>1, \bm{v}(\bm{z}) \in B\})$, for any
%$B\subset \mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the positive orthant of the unit 
%sphere in infinite norm. $\Phi$ is referred to as the {\em angular 
%measure}. Then 
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:exp-measure}
%    \mu\left(\left\lbrace  \bm{z} \in [0,\infty)^d : \lVert \bm{z} \rVert_{\infty} > r,\;\bm{z}/\lVert\bm{z}\rVert_{\infty} \in B\right\rbrace \right) = r^{-1}\Phi(B).
%\end{equation}
%Thus, the radial and angular components of the exponent measure are
%independent. To obtain a multivariate peak over threshold model we 
%consider the radial and angular component of the random variable $\bm{Z}$
%denoted, respectively, as $R = \max_{i} Z_i$ and $\bm{V} = \bm{Z}/R$. 
%Then, using Equations \ref{eq:reg-var} and \ref{eq:exp-measure}, we have
%that

%To obtain a statistical approach to estimating $\mu$, we follow the approach proposed in .
%Define  , and assume that it is distributed as a standard Pareto, and thus $R>1$ 
% with probability one. Also, define , and assume that $\bm{V}$ has probability distribution 
% $\Phi$ concentrated in $\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$, the positive orthant of the unit sphere 
% in infinite norm. Also, assume that $E(V_i)>0$, and that $ \bm{Z}$ and $R$ are independent. 
%We refer to $R$ and $\bm{V}$ as, respectively, the  of $\bm{Z}$. Under those assumptions,  
% the convergence stated in Equation \ref{eq:reg-var} holds with limit measure $\mu$ determined by

%\citep[e.g.][applied to the finite-dimensional case]{ferreira2014}
%\[
%    \mu\left(\left\lbrace  \bm{z} \in [0,\infty)^d : \lVert \bm{z} \rVert_{\infty} > r,\;\bm{z}/\lVert\bm{z}\rVert_{\infty} \in A\right\rbrace \right) = r^{-1}\Phi(A)
%\]
%for $r > 0$ and for Borel sets $A\subseteq \mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.

%    $\mu(tA) = \frac{1}{t}\mu(A)$.  Define  $R = \max_{i} Z_i$, and assume that $R>1$ with probability one. 
%    Also, define $V_i = Z_i/\max_i Z_i$, and assume that $E(V_i)>0$. These two assumptions together with the 
%    homogeneity of $\mu$ correspond to the second condition in Theorem 2.1 of
%    \cite{ferreira2014}, applied to the finite-dimensional case.
%    Thus, we have the factorization $\bm{Z} =  R\bm{V}$, where $R$ and $\bm{V}$  are independent. Moreover,
%    for some measure $\Phi$, $\mu(\cdot)$ is factorized as
%    \temp{\begin{equation}\label{mufact}
%        %\mu\left( \left\lbrace\bm{Z} : V \in A , R > r\right\rbrace \right) = r^{-1}\Phi(A).
%        \mu\left(\left\lbrace \bm{z}\in \mathbb{R}_+^d : R(\bm{z}) > r, V(\bm{z}) \in A\right\rbrace\right) = r^{-1}\Phi(A)
%    \end{equation}
%    for $R(\bm{Z}) > 0$, and Borel sets $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.  Hereafter $R$ is referred
%    to as the radial component, and $\bm{V}$ the angular component of $\bm{Z}$
%    \st{$R$ describes the radial component, and $\bm{V} \in {\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ the 
%    angular component of $\bm{Z}$.}}  Here ${\mathbb S}_\infty^{d-1}$ denotes the positive
%    orthant of the unit sphere in infinite norm.  $\Phi(\cdot)$ is referred to as the \emph{angular measure}.   
%    From Equation (\ref{mufact}) we see that $R$ is distributed as a standard Pareto random variable. Conditioning on $R$, we have that
%    \begin{equation} \label{MGP}
%        \prob{\bm{V} \in B \mid R > r} = \frac{r\prob{\bm{V} \in B, R > r}}{r\prob{R > r}}\hspace{0.2cm}
%            \xrightarrow[r\to\infty]{~} \hspace{0.2cm} \Phi(B),
%    \end{equation}
%as $\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty} r\prob{R>r} = 1$.
%    Thus, the angular measure corresponds to the distribution of $\bm{V}$, conditional on $R$ being large.
%    As such, it controls the dependence structure of $\bm{Z}$ in the tails. 
%    In fact, assuming that $E(V_i)>0$ 
%    and following \cite{ferreira2014}, in the limit the distribution function of $\bm{Z}$ is given as
%    \begin{equation*}
%        \prob{Z_1\leq z_1, \ldots ,Z_d\leq z_d} = \expect{\bigvee_{i=1}^d
%    \frac{V_i}{z_i\wedge 1}} - \expect{\bigvee_{i=1}^d
%    \frac{V_i}{z_i}}
%    \end{equation*}
%    where the expectation is taken with respect to $\Phi$
%In view of this, to obtain a PoT model we consider a limiting 
%distribution for $\bm{Z}$ that corresponds to the distribution
%of the product of two independent random variables $\tilde{R}$ 
%and $\tilde{\bm{V}}$, with distributions, respectively, standard 
%Pareto and $\Phi$. \cite{ferreira2014} refer to such model as a 
%simple  Pareto process indexed on a finite dimensional set.  We 
%seek a flexible model for the distribution
%of $\tilde{\bm{V}} \in {\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.

%An alternative approach to justify the above mentioned limiting
%distribution, that provides a link to the multivariate GEV and the
%theory of max-stable distributions, is discussed 
%in Remark 1 of \cite{RoSeWa2018a}. More specifically, 
%using the notation in Theorem 6 of \cite{RoSeWa2018a}, define $\bm{S} 
%=  \log(\tilde{\bm{V}})$.  Then, according to Definition 5, $\bm{S}$ 
%is a spectral  random vector. Taking  $E \sim \text{Exp}(1)$, 
%independent of  $\tilde{\bm{V}}$,  we have that $\bm{Y} = \bm{S} + E$  
%follows a multivariate GP, according  to Theorem 6.  Then, using 
%Proposition 4,  $\tilde{\bm{V}}\tilde{R} = e^{\bm{Y}}$ will also follow
%a multivariate GP. Notice that $\tilde{R} = e^E$ is distributed as 
%a standard Pareto random variable. This is one of several stochastic
%representations of a multivariate GP presented in \cite{RoSeWa2018a}.


%\subection{Pairwise Extremal Dependence\label{subsec:ped}}
%%A measure that is used to characterize the strength of the dependence,
%%in the tail, for two random variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, with marginal
%%distributions $F_1$ and $F_2$ is given by \citep{coles2001}.
%%\[
%%    \chi_{12} = \lim\limits_{u\uparrow 1} \prob{F_1(Z_1)>u\mid F_2(Z_2)>u}  
%%\]
%%$\chi_{12}$ provides information about the distribution of extremes for the variable $Z_1$
%%given that $Z_2$ is very large.  When $\chi_{12}>0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ 
%%are said to
%%be asymptotically dependent, otherwise they are asymptotically
%%independent. The following result provides the asymptotic dependence coefficient between two components of $\bm{Z}$
%%after PoT limit. 
%%\begin{prop}\label{ppchi}
%%Suppose that $\bm{Z} = R\bm{V}$ with $R\sim Pa(1)$,
%%$\prob{V_\ell > 0} = 1$ and $\expect{V_\ell}$ exists, for $\ell=1, \ldots ,d$, then
%%\begin{equation}
%%    \label{eqn:chi_ij}
%%	\chi_{\jmath\ell} = \expect{\frac{V_\jmath}{\expect{V_\jmath}} \wedge \frac{V_\ell}{\expect{V_\ell}}}
%%\end{equation}
%%\end{prop}
%%{\em Proof:}
%%Denote as $F_\ell$ the marginal distribution of $Z_\ell$. To obtain $\chi_{\jmath\ell}$ we need $Pr(Z_\jmath>z_\jmath,Z_\ell>z_\ell)$, where $z_\ell =
%%F_\ell^{-1}(u) = \expect{V_\ell}/(1 - u), \;\ell=1,\dots, d$.
%%Using the fact that
%%$V_\ell>0, \forall \ell$ almost surely, we have that the former is equal to
%%\begin{equation*}
%%    \begin{aligned}
%%    &\hspace{-0.5cm}\prob{R>\frac{z_\jmath}{V_\jmath}\vee\frac{z_\ell}{V_\ell}}
%%    = \expect{1\wedge\left(\frac{z_\jmath}{V_\jmath}\vee\frac{z_\ell}{V_\ell}\right)^{-1}}\\
%%    &= \expect{\frac{V_\jmath}{z_\jmath}\wedge\frac{V_\ell}{z_\ell}}
%%    = (1 - u)\expect{\frac{V_\jmath}{\expect{V_\jmath}}\wedge\frac{V_\ell}{\expect{V_\ell}}},
%%    \end{aligned}
%%\end{equation*}
%%where the second identity is justified by the fact that $V_i$ is
%%bounded and $z_i\rightarrow\infty$. The proof is completed by noting
%%that $\prob{F_i(Z_i)>u} = 1 - u. \hfill\Box$
%%
%%%\subsection{Multivariate Conditional Survival Function\label{subsec:condsurv}}
%%Equation \ref{eqn:chi_ij} implies that $\chi_{\jmath\ell}>0$, and so, no 
%% asymptotic independence is possible under our proposed model. For the analysis 
%% of extreme values it is of interest to calculate the multivariate conditional survival 
%% function. The following result provides the relevant expression, as a function of 
%% the angular measure.
%%\begin{prop}
%%Assume the same conditions of Proposition \ref{ppchi}. 
%%Let $\alpha \subset \{1, \ldots ,d\}$ be a collections of indexes. 
%%Then     
%%\begin{equation} \label{eqn:condsurv}
%%    \begin{aligned}
%%    &\hspace{-0.5cm}\mathrm{Pr}\left[\bigcap_{\ell \in \alpha} Z_\ell > z_\ell \mid \bigcap_{\ell\not\in\alpha} Z_\ell > z_\ell\right] \\
%%    &= \frac{\expect{\bigwedge_{k = 1}^d 1\wedge \frac{V_k}{z_k}}}{\expect{\bigwedge_{k \not\in\alpha}1\wedge\frac{V_k}{z_k}}}.
%%    \end{aligned}
%%  \end{equation}
%%\end{prop}  
%%The proof uses a similar approach to the proof of Proposition \ref{ppchi}.
