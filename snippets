Scope:
We contribute a Bayesian non-parametric model for flexible multivariate extreme value analysis

Novelty:
We describe the dependence structure of extremes using mixture of projected Gamma distributions.

Main Contribution:
EVT model based on arbitrary p-spheres projections; proper energy score on unit hypercube
