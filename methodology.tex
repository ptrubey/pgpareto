\section{Estimation of the angular measure\label{sec:methodology}}

Our approach to estimating the PoT distribution considers two 
steps: First we estimate the parameters of the univariate 
marginals; Then we focus on the dependence structure in extreme
regions.
Consider a collection of observations $\bm{w}_\ell \in {\mathbb R}^d,
\ell = 1, \ldots, n$ that exhibit extreme behavior. Following the 
ideas presented in the previous section, in order to estimate the
angular distribution we start by standardizing each
of the marginals. We set a large threshold $b_{t,\ell}$ for the 
$\ell$-th marginal, $\ell = 1, \ldots,d$, and assume that the 
corresponding exceedances follow a univariate GP. A threshold can 
be chosen using the empirical $1/t$-quantile for the $\ell$-th 
component. Thus $b_{t,l} = \hat{F}^{-1}_{\ell}(1 - 1/t)$. The  
standardization  yields
\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:standardization}
        z_{i\ell} = \left(1 + \xi_{\ell}\frac{w_{i\ell} -
            b_{\ell}}{a_{\ell}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_{\ell}}
    \end{equation}
where $(\cdot)_+$ indicates the positive parts function, and 
$\xi_{\ell}$ the extremal index in the $\ell$-th dimension. The scale parameters $a_\ell$, and extremal indexes $\xi_\ell$ can be fitted using a likelihood based method. Note that  $z_{i\ell}> 1$
implies that $w_{i\ell} > b_{t,\ell}$, meaning that the 
observation $\bm{w}_i$ is extreme in the $\ell$-th dimension. 
Note also that $r_i = ||\bm{z}_i||_\infty > 1$ implies that at
least one dimension has an extreme observation, and corresponds 
to a very extreme observation when $t$ is large. Thus, we focus on 
the observations that are such that $r_i > 1$. These, provide a
sub-sample of $r_i$ and $\bm{v}_i = \bm{z}_i /r_i \in 
\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ that is used for  the estimation of 
$\Phi$ conditional on the sample. We tackle the challenge
of obtaining a distribution in the constrained set  
$\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ by projecting a distribution defined on
$\mathbb{R}^d_+$.

%\temp{Let the distribution of $\bm{X} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ belong to the domain of attraction of a multivariate 
%    max-stable distribution, $G$.  Then, for independent and identically distributed $\bm{X}_1,\ldots,\bm{X}_N$, 
%    there exists some sequence of vectors $\bm{a}_N,\bm{b}_N$ such that 
%    \[
%        \text{P}\left[ \frac{\bigvee_k \bm{X}_k - \bm{b}_N}{\bm{a}_N} \leq \bm{w}\right] \to G(\bm{w})
%    \]
%    as $N\to\infty$.  If this is the case, and for $\bm{\epsilon}$ indicating an appropriate vector of lower bounds,
%    \[
%    \left(\frac{\bm{X} - \bm{b}_N}{\bm{a}_N}\right)\bigvee\bm{\epsilon} \mid \bm{X} 
%                                \not\leq \bm{b}_N \stackrel{d}{\to} \bm{W}
%    \]
%    where $\bm{W}$ follows a multivariate generalized Pareto distribution \citep{rootzen2018mgpd}.
%    From the survival function of the univariate generalized Pareto distribution, we extract the 
%    standardization formula to transform the generalized Pareto vector to standard Pareto.  This 
%    is accomplished as
%    \begin{equation}
%        \label{eqn:standardization}
%        Z_{\ell} = \left(1 + \xi_{\ell}\frac{X_{\ell} -
%            b_{\ell}}{a_{\ell}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_{\ell}}
%    \end{equation}
%    where $(\cdot)_+$ indicates the positive parts function, and $\xi_{\ell}$ the extremal index
%    in the $\ell$th dimension.  Now, consider $\bm{x}_k\in {\mathbb R}^d,\; k=1, \ldots , N$ to be 
%    replicates of $\bm{X}$.  Our task at this point is to establish estimates of the generalized Pareto
%    parameters such that we can transform to standard Pareto, and begin estimation of the angular measure.
%    First a large threshold $b_{\ell}$ is chosen for the $\ell$th margin; for which corresponding exceedances
%    will follow a univariate GP.  There are several ways to approach threshold specification,
%    with~\cite{kiriliouk2018} considering another definition of the extremal dependence 
%    coefficient, and looking for threshold values that produce stable estimates of said 
%    coefficient.  For our purpose, as threshold specification is not the focus of this paper, 
%    we follow the discussion in~\cite{ferreira2014} wherein we set a threshold using the empirical 
%    $(1 - 1/t)$th quantile for the $\ell$th component.  Thus, 
%    $b_{t,\ell} = \hat{F}_{\ell}^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{1}{t}\right)$.  
%    Using the density of the generalized Pareto, the marginal scale parameter $a_{\ell}$ 
%    and extremal index $\xi_{\ell}$ can be estimated using a likelihood-based approach.  Then, substituting
%    $b_{t,\ell}$ for $b_{\ell}$, we can use Equation~\ref{eqn:standardization} to transform $\bm{x}_k$ to $\bm{z}_k$, 
%    for $k$ such that $\bm{x}_{k} \not\leq \bm{b}_{t}$.  Note that this is equivalent to the statement 
%    $r_k = \lVert \bm{z}_k\rVert_{\infty} > 1$.}  
%    
%    \temp{Thus we perform estimation of $\Phi$ conditional on the 
%    standardized observations where $r_k > 1$.  We index over this subset 
%    $\bm{z}_i$, $i = 1,\ldots,n$ and factor these $\bm{z}_i$ independently into $r_i \in (1,\infty)$, 
%    and $\bm{V}_i \in \mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.  The second space, the positive 
%    orthant of the unit hypersphere under the $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$ norm, could be considered as the 
%    union of $d$ unit hypercubes, with a distribution trivially composed as such.  However, such a 
%    method would fail to adequately represent density near intersections.  We instead propose considering
%    $\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ as the limiting case of $\mathbb{S}_{p}^{d-1}$: the positive orthant of the 
%    unit hypersphere under the $\mathcal{L}_p$ norm, and projecting a distribution in $\mathbb{R}_+^d$ onto
%    $\mathbb{S}_{p}^{d-1}$.}
% Consider a collection of observations $\bm{x}_i\in {\mathbb R}^d,\; i=1, \ldots , n$
%     \temp{\st{that exhibit extreme behavior.} for which the marginal distributions 
%     of $x_{i\ell}$ fall into the domain of attraction of the GEV.  To consider $\bm{x}$

%   where $(\cdot)_{+}$ indicates the positive part function. The scale parameters 
%   $a_{\ell}$, and extremal indexes $\xi_{\ell}$ can be fitted using a likelihood

%   $\bm{x}_i$ is extreme in the $\ell$th dimension.  Note also that 
%   $r_i = ||\bm{z}_i||_\infty>1$ implies that at least one dimension has an extreme
%   observation.  Thus, we perform the estimation of $\Phi$ conditional on the standardized

%   $r_i$ and $\bm{v}_i = \bm{z}_i/r_i\in{\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$. \temp{\st{We are, as yet,
