\section{Estimation of the angular measure\label{sec:methodology}}

Our approach to estimating the PoT distribution considers two 
steps: First we estimate the parameters of the univariate 
marginals; Then we focus on the dependence structure in extreme
regions.
Consider a collection of observations $\bm{w}_\ell \in {\mathbb R}^d,
\ell = 1, \ldots, n$ that exhibit extreme behavior. Following the 
ideas presented in the previous section, in order to estimate the
angular distribution we start by standardizing each
of the marginals. We set a large threshold $b_{t,\ell}$ for the 
$\ell$-th marginal, $\ell = 1, \ldots,d$, and assume that the 
corresponding exceedances follow a univariate GP. A threshold can 
be chosen using the empirical $1/t$-quantile for the $\ell$-th 
component. Thus $b_{t,l} = \hat{F}^{-1}_{\ell}(1 - 1/t)$. The  
standardization  yields
\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:standardization}
        z_{i\ell} = \left(1 + \xi_{\ell}\frac{w_{i\ell} -
            b_{\ell}}{a_{\ell}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_{\ell}}
    \end{equation}
where $(\cdot)_+$ indicates the positive parts function, and 
$\xi_{\ell}$ the extremal index in the $\ell$-th dimension. The scale parameters $a_\ell$, and extremal indexes $\xi_\ell$ can be fitted using a likelihood based method. Note that  $z_{i\ell}> 1$
implies that $w_{i\ell} > b_{t,\ell}$, meaning that the 
observation $\bm{w}_i$ is extreme in the $\ell$-th dimension. 
Note also that $r_i = ||\bm{z}_i||_\infty > 1$ implies that at
least one dimension has an extreme observation, and corresponds 
to a very extreme observation when $t$ is large. Thus, we focus on 
the observations that are such that $r_i > 1$. These, provide a
sub-sample of $r_i$ and $\bm{v}_i = \bm{z}_i /r_i \in 
\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ that is used for  the estimation of 
$\Phi$ conditional on the sample. We tackle the challenge
of obtaining a distribution in the constrained set  
$\mathbb{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ by projecting a distribution defined on
$\mathbb{R}^d_+$.
