\section{Estimation of the angular measure\label{sec:methodology}}

Consider a collection of observations $\bm{w}_\ell\in {\mathbb R}^d, \ell=1, \ldots , n$ that exhibit extreme behavior. In order to estimate the angular distribution we start by standardizing each of the marginals. We set a large threshold $b_{t,\ell}$ for the $\ell$-th marginal, $\ell=1, \ldots ,d$, and assume that the corresponding exceedances follow a univariate GP. A threshold can be chosen using the empirical $1/t$-quantile for the $\ell$-th component. Thus $b_{t,\ell} = \hat{F}_\ell^{-1}(1 - 1/t)$. Standardization yields

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:standardization}
    z_{i\ell} = \left(1 + \xi_{\ell}\frac{w_{i\ell} - b_{t,\ell}}{a_{\ell}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_{\ell}}
\end{equation}
  where $(\cdot)_{+}$ indicates the positive part function. The scale parameters $a_{\ell}$, and extremal indexes $\xi_{\ell}$ can be fitted using a likelihood based method.
 Note that $z_{i\ell} > 1$ implies that $w_{i\ell} > b_{t,\ell}$, meaning that the observation
  $\bm{w}_i$ is extreme in the $\ell$-th dimension.  Note also that $r_i = ||\bm{w}_i||_\infty>1$ implies that at least one dimension has an extreme observation, and corresponds to a very extreme observation when $t$ is large. Thus, we perform the estimation of $\Phi$ conditional on the standardized observations that are such that $r_i>1$. From these, we obtain a sub-sample of $r_i$ and
  $\bm{v}_i = \bm{z}_i/r_i\in{\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$. We are as yet unaware of any known distributions with a support
  in this space, so we propose projecting a distribution defined on ${\mathbb R}_{+}^{d}$ onto
  ${\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.
