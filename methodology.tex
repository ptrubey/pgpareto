\section{Estimation of the angular measure}

Consider a collection of observations that correspond to independent replicates of  random vector $\bm{W}\in {\mathbb R}^d$ and that exhibit extreme behavior. In order to estimate the angular distribution we start by standardizing each of the marginals. We set a large threshold $b_{t,i}$ for the $i$-th marginal, and assume that the corresponding exceedances follow a univariate GP. A threshold can be chosen using the empirical $1/t$-quantile fot he $i$-th component. Thus $b_{t,i} = \hat{F}_i(1 - 1/t)$. Standardization yields

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:standardization}
    Z_{i} = \left(1 + \xi_{i}\frac{W_{i} - b_{t,i}}{a_{i}}\right)_{+}^{1/\xi_{i}}
\end{equation}
  where $(\cdot)_{+}$ indicates the positive part function. The scale parameters $a_{i}$, and extremal indexes $\xi_{i}$ can be fitted using a likelihood based method.
 Note that $Z_{i} > 1$ implies that $w_{i} > b_{t,i}$, meaning that the observation
  $\bm{w}$ is extreme in the $i$-th dimension.  Note also that $R>1$ implies that at least one dimension has an extreme observation, and corresponds to a very extreme observation when $t$ is large. Thus, we perform the estimation of $\Phi$ conditional on the standardized observations that are such that $R>1$. From these, we obtain a sample of $R$ and
  $\bm{V}\in\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$. We are as yet unaware of any known distributions with a support
  in this space, so we propose projecting a distribution defined on ${\mathbb R}_{+}^{d}$ onto
  $\mathcal{S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.
