{\bf We need an abstract}

The constructive definition of the multivariate Pareto introduced 
    in~\cite{ferreira2014} separates the Pareto RV $\bm{z}\in {\mathbb R}^d\not[0,1]^d$
    into independent radial,  $r \in (1,\infty)$ and angular 
    $\bm{y} \in {\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$ components.
    This paper proposes a method for inferring a density on ${\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$
    as the limit of a series of manifolds, ${\mathbb S}_{p}^{d-1}$.  We project a
    distribution in ${\mathbb R}_+^d$ to ${\mathbb S}_p^{d-1}$; then as $p$ grows
    large, we approach a density on ${\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.

We discuss model selection criteria appropriate to ${\mathbb S}_{\infty}^{d-1}$.  We
    use the energy score criterion introduced in \cite{gneiting2007}, incorporating a
    novel kernel metric we develop suitable to the space.  We use this energy score, along
    with posterior predictive loss to inform model choice in how well we recover the distribution of simulated data.  We then fit these models to real data
