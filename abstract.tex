We consider a constructive definition of the multivariate Pareto that factorizes the 
random vector into a radial component and an independent angular component. The former
follows a univariate Pareto distribution. The latter is defined on the surface of the 
positive orthant of the unit  hypercube.  In this paper, we  propose a method for
inferring the distribution of the angular component.  We   identify its support 
as the limit of the positive orthant of the unit $p$--norm spheres, 
and describe a method to project a distribution onto those spheres. To define a 
distribution in the $p$--norm spheres, we introduce a family of projected Gamma 
distributions. This family serves as a building block for a flexible family of 
distributions obtained as  a Dirichlet process mixture of projected Gammas. For 
model comparison and assessment, we discuss model scoring methods appropriate 
to distributions on the unit hypercube.  In particular, we develop a kernel metric 
that produces a proper scoring rule.   We present a simulation study to compare 
different modeling choices using the proposed  scoring rules. We then apply our 
approach to study the extreme values of the  magnitude of the integrated vapor 
transport (IVT), that describes the rate of flow of moisture in the atmosphere 
along the coast of California for the years of 1979 through 2020.
